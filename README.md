It consists of 4 assignments on Human forms, Perspectives, Orthographic view &amp; Isometric view.

                              Orthographic drawing
An orthographic drawing represents a 3-dimensional object using several 2-dimensional views of the object. 
1. Top View – Plan 
2. Front View – Front Elevation 
3. Right Side View – Side Elevation 
4. Left Side View – Side Elevation


		                          Isometric drawing
Objects drawn with isometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. Unlike perspective projection, it is not how human vision or photography normally work. It can however, result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge.
