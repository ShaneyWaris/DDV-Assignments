# DDV(Design Drawing & Visualization)-Assignments
It consists of 4 assignments on Human forms, Perspectives, Orthographic view &amp; Isometric view.

                              Orthographic drawing
- An orthographic drawing represents a 3-dimensional object using several 2-dimensional views of the object. 
- Orthographic drawing are drawn at 90 degrees
- Orthographic drawing is used for making the projects

1. Top View – Plan 
2. Front View – Front Elevation 
3. Right Side View – Side Elevation 
4. Left Side View – Side Elevation


		                 Isometric drawing
- Isometric drawing are used to visually represent the 3 Dimensional Objects in Two Dimensions.
- In isometric drawing, the three coordinate axes appear equally foreshortened and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees.
- Isometric drawing is used to have better understanding of the object.
- Objects drawn with isometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. Unlike           perspective projection, it is not how human vision or photography normally work. It can however, result in situations where depth and       altitude are difficult to gauge.
